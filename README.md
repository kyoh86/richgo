# NOTICE (what I think about `richgo`)

For some years, I've not been using `richgo`.
Now I don't feel much effect that a little bit of tweaking to the appearance of the test output.
And It is poor method that `richgo` parses and adjusts the standard output of `go test`.
So now I recommend you that you do NOT use `richgo`, get use to pure `go test`, train an ability to find the error from the output and contribute to improve official `go test` if you needed.
Some may think that I have too much faith in pure Go, but this is my honest feeling.


# Installation

(go get):

```
go get -u github.com/kyoh86/richgo
```

(homebrew):

```
brew install kyoh86/tap/richgo
```

(asdf):

```
asdf plugin add richgo
asdf install richgo 0.3.6
```

# Usage

## Basic

```sh
richgo test ./...
```

## In an existing pipeline

If your build scripts expect to interact with the standard output format of `go
test` (for instance, if you're using
[go-junit-report](https://github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report)), you'll need to
use the `testfilter` subcommand of `richgo`.

For example:

```sh
go test ./... | tee >(richgo testfilter) | go-junit-report
```

This will "tee" the output of the standard `go test` run into a `richgo
testfilter` process as well as passing the original output to
`go-junit-report`.

Note that at some point this recommendation may change, as the "go test" tool
may learn how to produce a standard output format
[golang/go#2981](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/2981) that both this tool
and others could rely on.

## alias

You can define alias so that `go test` prints rich outputs:

* bash: `~/.bashrc`
* zsh: `~/.zshrc`

```
alias go=richgo
```

## Configure

### Configuration file paths

It's possible to change styles with the preference file.
Rich-Go loads preferences from the files in the following order.

* `${CWD}/.richstyle`
* `${CWD}/.richstyle.yaml`
* `${CWD}/.richstyle.yml`
* `${GOPATH}/.richstyle`
* `${GOPATH}/.richstyle.yaml`
* `${GOPATH}/.richstyle.yml`
* `${GOROOT}/.richstyle`
* `${GOROOT}/.richstyle.yaml`
* `${GOROOT}/.richstyle.yml`
* `${HOME}/.richstyle`
* `${HOME}/.richstyle.yaml`
* `${HOME}/.richstyle.yml`

Setting the environment variable `RICHGO_LOCAL` to 1, Rich-Go loads only `${CWD}/.richstyle*`.

### Configuration file format

**Now Rich-Go supports only YAML formatted.**

```yaml
# Type of the label that notes a kind of each lines.
labelType: (long | short | none)

# Style of "Build" lines.
buildStyle:
  # Hide lines
  hide: (true | false)
  # Bold or increased intensity.
  bold: (true | false)
  faint: (true | false)
  italic: (true | false)
  underline: (true | false)
  blinkSlow: (true | false)
  blinkRapid: (true | false)
  # Swap the foreground color and background color.
  inverse: (true | false)
  conceal: (true | false)
  crossOut: (true | false)
  frame: (true | false)
  encircle: (true | false)
  overline: (true | false)
  # Fore-color of text
  foreground: ("#xxxxxx" | rgb(0-256,0-256,0-256) | rgb(0x00-0xFF,0x00-0xFF,0x00-0xFF) | (name of colors))
  # Back-color of text
  background: # Same format as `foreground`

# Style of the "Start" lines.
startStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "Pass" lines.
passStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "Fail" lines.
failStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "Skip" lines.
skipStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "File" lines.
fileStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "Line" lines.
lineStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "Pass" package lines.
passPackageStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "Fail" package lines.
failPackageStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# A threashold of the coverage
coverThreshold: (0-100)

# Style of the "Cover" lines with the coverage that is higher than coverThreshold.
coveredStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# Style of the "Cover" lines with the coverage that is lower than coverThreshold.
uncoveredStyle:
  # Same format as `buildStyle`

# If you want to delete lines, write the regular expressions.
removals:
  - (regexp)
# If you want to leave `Test` prefixes, set it "true".
leaveTestPrefix: (true | false)
```

### Line categories

Rich-Go separate the output-lines in following categories.

* Build:  
  When the Go fails to build, it prints errors like this:

  <pre><code># github.com/kyoh86/richgo/sample/buildfail
  sample/buildfail/buildfail_test.go:6: t.Foo undefined (type testing.T has no field or method Foo)</code></pre>

* Start:  
  In the top of test, Go prints that name like this:

  <pre><code>=== RUN   TestSampleOK/SubtestOK</code></pre>

* Pass:  
  When a test is successed, Go prints that name like this:

  <pre><code>    ---PASS: TestSampleOK/SubtestOK</code></pre>

* Fail:  
  When a test is failed, Go prints that name like this:

  <pre><code>--- FAIL: TestSampleNG (0.00s)
  sample_ng_test.go:9: It's not OK... :(</code></pre>

* Skip:  
  If there is no test files in directory or a test is skipped, Go prints that path or the name like this:

  <pre><code>--- SKIP: TestSampleSkip (0.00s)
  sample_skip_test.go:6:
?     github.com/kyoh86/richgo/sample/notest  [no test files]</code></pre>

* PassPackage:  
  When tests in package are successed, Go prints just:

  <pre><code>PASS</code></pre>

* Fail:  
  When a test in package are failed, Go prints just:

  <pre><code>FAIL</code></pre>

* Cover:  
  If the coverage analysis is enabled, Go prints the coverage like this:

  <pre><code>=== RUN   TestCover05
--- PASS: TestCover05 (0.00s)
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/kyoh86/richgo/sample/cover05	0.012s	coverage: 50.0% of statements</code></pre>

Each categories can be styled seperately.

### Label types

* Long:
  * Build: "BUILD"
  * Start: "START"
  * Pass: "PASS"
  * Fail: "FAIL"
  * Skip: "SKIP"
  * Cover: "COVER"

* Short:
  * Build: "!!"
  * Start: ">"
  * Pass: "o"
  * Fail: "x"
  * Skip: "-"
  * Cover: "%"

* None:
  Rich-Go will never output labels.

### Default

```yaml
labelType: long
buildStyle:
  bold: true
  foreground: yellow
startStyle:
  foreground: lightBlack
passStyle:
  foreground: green
failStyle:
  bold: true
  foreground: red
skipStyle:
  foreground: lightBlack
passPackageStyle:
  foreground: green
  hide: true
failPackageStyle:
  bold: true
  foreground: red
  hide: true
coverThreshold: 50
coveredStyle:
  foreground: green
uncoveredStyle:
  bold: true
  foreground: yellow
fileStyle:
  foreground: cyan
lineStyle:
  foreground: magenta
```

## Overriding colorization detection

By default, `richgo` determines whether or not to colorize its output based
on whether it's connected to a TTY or not. This works for most use cases, but
may not behave as expected if you use `richgo` in a pipeline of commands, where
STDOUT is being piped to another command.

To force colorization, add `RICHGO_FORCE_COLOR=1` to the environment you're
running in. For example:

```sh
RICHGO_FORCE_COLOR=1 richgo test ./... | tee test.log
```

## Configure to resolve a conflict with "Solarized dark" theme

The bright-black is used for background color in Solarized dark theme.
Richgo uses that color for "startStyle" and "skipStyle", so "START" and "SKIP" lines can not be seen on the screen with Solarized dark theme.

To resolve that conflict, you can set another color for "startStyle" and "skipStyle" in [.richstyle](#configuration-file-paths) like below.

```
startStyle:
  foreground: yellow

skipStyle:
  foreground: lightYellow
```

## Getting a version of the richgo

If you want to get a version of the `richgo`, this information is embedded in the binary (since Go 1.18).
You can view it with go version -m, e.g. for richgo 0.3.10:

```console
$ go version -m $(command -v richgo)
./richgo: go1.18
	path	github.com/kyoh86/richgo
	mod	github.com/kyoh86/richgo	v0.3.10	h1:iSGvcjhtQN2IVrBDhPk0if0R/RMQnCN1E/9OyAW4UUs=
	[...]
```

And just a little more advanced way (with POSIX `awk`):

```console
$ go version -m $(command -v richgo) | awk '$1 == "mod" && $2 == "github.com/kyoh86/richgo" {print $3;}'
v0.3.10
```
